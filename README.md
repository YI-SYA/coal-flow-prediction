# Coal Flow Setting Prediction Using Machine Learning  

This project utilizes **Linear Regression** to predict the optimal **coal flow** setting in a power plant. By analyzing operational data, the model helps improve combustion efficiency and optimize fuel usage.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Predicts coal flow based on operational parameters.  
- Uses **Linear Regression** for accurate predictions.  
- Helps optimize power plant performance.  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The model is trained using the following key features:  
- **Flue Gas CO**: Indicates combustion efficiency.  
- **Calorific Value (NK)**: Energy content of coal.  
- **Gross Load**: Power output affecting fuel needs.  
- **Coal Flow** (Target Variable): The setting to be optimized.
